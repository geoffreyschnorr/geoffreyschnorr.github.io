__California Unemployment Insurance Claims During the COVID-19 Pandemic__
*with Alex Bell, Thomas J. Hedin, and Till von Wachter*
I am part of a team of researchers at CPL working with the State of California's Employment Development Department to analyze nearly real-time administrative Unemployment Insurance claims data during the Coronavirus crisis. Our findings have been released in a series of Policy Briefs, which you can find [here](https://www.capolicylab.org/california-unemployment-insurance-claims-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/). This work has received media coverage from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/business/economy/unemployment-claims-numbers.html), the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/30/weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment/), and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/30/weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment/), among others.
