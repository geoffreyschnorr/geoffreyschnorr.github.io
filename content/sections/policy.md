I am part of a team of researchers at the California Policy Lab working with the State of California's Employment Development Department to analyze nearly real-time administrative Unemployment Insurance claims data during the Coronavirus crisis. Our findings have been released in a series of Policy Briefs, which you can find at the link above. This work has received media coverage from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/business/economy/unemployment-claims-numbers.html), the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-06-05/black-jobs-coronavirus), and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/30/weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment/), among others.
