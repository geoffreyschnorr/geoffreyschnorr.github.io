I am a 6th year PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I also work as a Graduate Student Assistant at the State of California's Employment Development Department for the [California Policy Lab](https://www.capolicylab.org/).

My primary research interests are related to the design of social insurance and safety net programs. I am also interested in the economics of health behaviors. My recent work on the US Unemployment Insurance program has been funded by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and the Bilinski Educational Foundation.
