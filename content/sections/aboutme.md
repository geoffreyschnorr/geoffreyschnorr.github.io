I am a 6th year PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ucdavis.edu/) at UC-Davis. I also work as a Graduate Student Assistant at California's Employment Development Department for the [California Policy Lab](https://www.capolicylab.org/).

My primary research interests are related to the design of social insurance and safety net programs. I am also interested in the economics of health behaviors. My recent work on the US Unemployment Insurance program has been funded by the [Washington Center for Equitable Growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/) and the Bilinski Educational Foundation.
